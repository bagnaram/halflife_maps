#+TITLE: Half-life maps

This repository contains a set of historic Half-Life =vmf= maps. They are built
in Hammer Editor. There are also a set of compiled =bsp= maps to play directly.
I hope these can be of help for mappers or just a bit of enjoyment.


The compiled =bsp= maps that contain custom textures have been added to the file
container. This means that custom materials and textures are bundled in the
file. I used the tool [[http://www.map-lounge.de][Map Analyst]] by Rolf Haenisch to pack the BSP files. If you
wish to obtain the materials yourself for a compile, use the utility to extract
them to your =$GAMEROOT/materials= or =$GAMEROOT/models= directory.

** dm_city
