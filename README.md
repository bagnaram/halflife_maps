# Half-Life maps

This repository contains a set of historic Half-Life `vmf` maps. They are built
in Hammer Editor. There are also a set of compiled `bsp` maps that I haven't had
a chance to recover & decompile.

* **Citystreet**: A HL2 deathmatch that features a multi-level street with
  buildings you can enter, and an underneath sewer area.
* **dm_citystreet**: An iteration on the above map. Perhaps it's a later
  version?
* **h20**: A HL2 singleplayer map. This one is a large outside beach test level
  that turned into a small
* **lab**: ? story. There is a fastzombie (relish) that has a cage welded to its
  movement.
* **map**: ?
* **mapcbeta**: A HL deathmatch. This is part of the undertow series. It is an
  expansion of the origional dm_undertow.
* **mapd**: A HL deathmatch map. This is a part of the undertow series.
* **undertow_huge_g_d.vmf**: A HL deathmatch map. This is a part of the undertow
  series.
* **rp_campsite_d**: A garrysmod map. This is a large role-playing map where you
  can build campers and go camping outside.
* **zoggerlift**: I don't know why I have this. It is a tutorial for building a
  full elevator based on `func_tracktrain`.
* **sonnys_005**: A garrysmod map. This is a great Sonny's BBQ map.
* **racetrak**: A garrysmod map. Tais is a dog track.
